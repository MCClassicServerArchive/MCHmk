MCHmk
=====

MCHmk is a personal fork of MCForge-Redux maintained by
Jjp137.

This software was initially based on MCForge 5.5.0.2's
source code. It is now based on MCForge-Redux, although code
from later revisions as well as MCGalaxy have been included
since then.

The source code of the Git revision of MCForge-Redux that MCHmk
is based on can be found here:
