for a more detailed look at what exactly has been changed. This file 
is a non-programmer's guide to what has been changed.
---------------
r21 (???):
- Blocks placed by /place now count towards block spam, preventing
clients from using /place to get around the anti-grief system.

r20 (2018-04-09):
- Added /pclients from MCGalaxy. Thanks to UnknownShadow200
for the pull request.
- Fixed /cmdbind [num?] not working properly. Thanks to
UnknownShadow200 for describing the bug.
- Fixed /unload empty not working properly. This fix was taken
from MCGalaxy.
- Fixed an exploit with /banip and /unbanip.
- Fixed an exploit with /view.
- Fixed /physics 5 not working correctly recent .NET/Mono versions.
- Fixed /spin not working on recent .NET/Mono versions.
- Make it less likely for two or more clients with the same player
name to successfully connect to the server if the connections
are performed around the same time.
- Removed /lockdown and /unlock.
- Restricted the characters that filenames for various commands,
such as /save <map?> <name?>, /view, and /retrieve, can use. If you
are having trouble accessing a file from the server, try renaming
it to use alphanumeric characters only.

r19 (2016-02-06):
- Removed ban reasons for now.
- Removed some annoying messages related to static mode that
were introduced on accident in r18.
- Removed the unused rank-super option from server.properties.
- Removed the repeat-message option from server.properties.
Message blocks will now always show their messages, even if
repeatedly activated.
- Removed the guest-limit-notify, guest-join-notify, and
guest-leave-notify options from server.properties. Messages
will always be shown when a guest leaves or joins the server,
but never if the guest limit is exceeded. The latter case will
still be noted in the server's log.
- Fixed a regression from r15 where /fakepay imitated /give.
- Fixed color codes at the end of titles leaking into the player's
name. This fix was taken from MCGalaxy.
- Fixed IRC showing a "player disconnected" message if the player
disconnecting was hidden. This fix was taken from MCGalaxy.
- Fixed /copylvl not working properly.
- Fixed /restore causing an error if the backup being restored to
was smaller than the current map.
- Fixed /restore listing the file paths of every backup on Linux.
- Fixed /search giving no feedback if the category was misspelled.
- Changed the output of /whois and /whowas.

r18 (2016-01-23):
- Added /durl back in. This should only be used if minecraft.net
logins still need to be supported.
- Added /zombiespawn back in.
- Removed griefer stones. All griefer_stone blocks will be
converted to smooth stone blocks. All related settings in
server.properties have been removed.
- Removed plugin support and custom commands.

- Fixed total bans (/ban @name) not working from the console.
- Fixed a regression from r15 where $name did not work.
- Fixed a regression from r17 where no one can log in if the
whitelist was disabled.
- Fixed a regression from r17 where /retrieve didn't work
for any copies stored when using r17.
- Fixed a bug with /ascend not working properly with
levels of different dimensions.
- Fixed a bug with active liquids destroying CPE blocks when
the map's physics setting is 2 to 4.
- Fixed a bug where the number of blocks a player modified was
being counted incorrectly. This fix was taken from MCGalaxy.
- Fixed /ellipse being missing from r15 onwards.
- Fixed /explode creating an explosion on the wrong level if
the target player is in a different level. Thanks to
UnknownShadow200 for pointing towards this bug.
- Fixed some commands never appearing in /search results.
- Fixed some commands appearing twice in /search results.
- Fixed /voteresults not being displayed in /help.
- Fixed /redo not working. Thanks to UnknownShadow200 for sharing
information about the cause on IRC.
- Changed /line. The wall and straight parameters can be provided
together now. The text for /help line has also been improved.
- Changed /measure [*block*]. Instead of not counting blocks of
that type, it only counts blocks of the given type, if specified.
- /pyramid now uses the currently held block instead of stone
if no block is specified.
- Changed /pyramid reverse. It is no longer hollow.
- /shutdown now accepts 0 as the seconds parameter.
Thanks to LegoBricker for implementing this.
- Changed /splace. It now uses the currently held block.
- Changed /tcolor. Its syntax is the same as /color now.
- Changed /weather. The forecast parameter is now required.
Thanks to LegoBricker for working on this.
- Changed the "Someone logged in as you!" message.

r17 (2015-02-03):
This version of MCHmk adds support for Minecraft's uuids. However,
before you update to this version, you must run the ChangeToUUID
program that is also on the download page in order to convert
your data to support this change. If you do not do this, errors
will definitely occur. All admin passwords will be reset during
the conversion process as well.
--
Here is the usual set of changes:
- Removed support for e-mail logins.
- Removed custom login and logout messages.
- Removed the premium-only option from server.properties.
- Fixed a regression from r15 where /resetpass didn't work.
- Fixed SQLite not working on Macs. Credit to LegoBricker
for helping me resolve this issue.

r16 (2015-01-20):
- Fixed a regression introduced in r15 where muted players who
leave the server were not being muted again when they rejoin.
- Fixed a regression introduced in r15 where /museum did not work
for levels in .lvl format.
- The CPE fire block is now bound to /fire. The old "fire" block
is renamed to /embers. You will need to adjust the rank of the
fire block accordingly.
- Similarly, the CPE magma block is now bound to /magma. The
old "magma" block is renamed to /active_magma. You will need to
adjust the rank of the magma block accordingly.
- Fixed "no longer AFK" messages sometimes not appearing in IRC.
- /server was removed temporarily.
- /restart was removed.
- The restart-on-error option in server.properties was removed.
- /write underwent internal improvements. Thanks to LegoBricker
for working on this task.

r15 (2015-01-08):
This version of MCHmk is based on a recent build of MCForge 6+,
and thus, many of the changes come from MCForge, including:
- Preliminary support for ClassiCube extensions, including
custom blocks.
- Support for the ClassiCube heartbeat.
- Removal of the WoM heartbeat.
- Added the /weather and /model commands. These only work if
you are using ClassiCube or any other client that supports
the CPE protocol.
- A new level format that supports a greater variety of blocks
is implemented. These levels are saved with the .mcf extension.
- /unloaded now displays the perbuild color of each level,
and it lets players know what levels they can visit.
- /review has been changed.
---------
There are also several bugfixes and changes from r14:
- MCHmk should more reliably work with newer versions of Mono now.
- Level data is now properly saved when the server shuts down.
- Reverted the default rank of /delete to advbuilder.
- If the autoload setting in server.properties is false, the
list of loaded levels will be preserved when the server shuts
down, and the server will load those levels when the server
starts again. This fixes a regression introduced in r2.

r14 (2012-10-29):
- Fixed a bug where /players did not work from the console
if a player is hidden.
- Removed CTF entirely.
- Changed /devs a little bit.

r13 (2012-09-25):
- Important bugfix regarding the heartbeat. Please note:
on systems that use Mono, the command 'mozroots --import
--sync' must be run before you start the server, or else
no one will be able to see your server.

r12 (2012-08-27):
- ConsoleMCHmk.exe should be used to start the server now.
Delete MCHmk.exe.
- The bug where /fly did not work if any of the player's
coordinates was 0 was fixed. In other words, /fly now works
if you are on certain edges of the map and if you are on the
bottom of the map.
- Falling deaths have been somewhat fixed.
- Fixed an exploit involving portals.
- Fixed an exploit with /store.
- Fixed an exploit in the admin verification system. However,
you will need to make all the filenames in extra/passwords/
lowercase in order for your current passwords to work still.
(Credit to the MCForge team for this one; it was ported from
MCForge 5.5.0.3.)
- Fixed portals checking the pervisit of the wrong map.
- Fixed a bug where those who had permission to use /pervisitmax
were sliently not able to visit some maps.
- Fixed a bug where /maze did not check the player's cuboid limit.
- /mute now accepts a seconds parameter. Thanks to LegoBricker
for implementing this.
- /xmute has been removed as a result of the above change.
- Removed /copy's ability to load from and save to online
locations.
- Other minor fixes.

r11 (2012-07-21):
- Fixed /resetbot freezing console's input for a few seconds.
- Properly fixed a client crash exploit with $color.

r10 (2012-07-18):
- Disabled the use of $color to prevent a client crash exploit.
This will be properly fixed later.

r9 (2012-07-16):
- Changed the profanity filter. Basically, it is less greedy
about filtering at the expense of not catching everything. Also, 
the bug that replaced all chat with asterisks if badwords.txt 
had a line with only whitespace was fixed. (There may be a setting
to tweak how strict the filter is later.)
- Fixed an issue with the new money limit and MySQL databases that
would cause /whois data loss.

r8 (2012-07-11):
- Really fixed /help ranks for real.
- Fixed /rules [*player*] not working.
- Fixed TNT not killing players (regression introduced in r3).
- Removed several obsolete server properties.
- server.properties is more organized.
- /levels has changed, and it also works from the console now.
- /vip creates vips.txt if it doesn't exist now. This should prevent
the VIP system from not working.
- Console's chat and command usage is now logged.
- The correct message now appears when using /kick from the console
with no reason provided.
- Prevented two or more instances of /shutdown occurring.
Thanks to LegoBricker for doing this.
- ? is supported by /write now, and ; is fixed.
- /rankinfo works with offline players now, and it is no longer
case-sensitive.
- /rankinfo does not report erroneous entries anymore.
- /players [*rank*] works now. Thanks to LegoBricker for fixing this.
- /players now shows the nobody rank when one is online. Thanks to
LegoBricker for adding this.
- /players now shows any hidden players if the person using
the command is of equal or greater rank to them. Thanks to
LegoBricker for adding this.
- There is now a '/report delete all' thanks to LegoBricker.
- The server no longer crashes when the IRC bot loses connection.
However, the IRC bot will not reconnect automatically. Use /resetbot
to restart the bot. (If someone has a better fix, let me know!)
- Increased the amount of money a player can have to about 2^31.
- /fakepay now prints the pay message instead of the give message.
- The server owner will no longer automatically have the title [Owner]
if he has no title.
- /museum with named backups now works.
- /me actions in IRC are now sent to the server.
- Fixed opchat/adminchat producing errors if the opchannel is 
left blank.
- /map instant is no longer reserved for superop+.
- Other minor edits.

r7 (2012-06-20):
- Fixed /khide's IRC messages.
- Fixed /help ranks incorrectly displaying permission values.
- Minor /help nitpick fixed.
- CTF works again, but it's not stable. Use at your own risk.

r6 (2012-06-18):
- Changed the output of /devs.
- Removed /baninfo's shortcut since it conflicted with another one.
- Shortcuts are now displayed with each command when using /help.
- /help short and /help old have been removed since they filled
up the whole screen anyways and were therefore unreadable.
- Removed the following server settings: dollar-before-dollar,
old-help, check-updates.
- Added Legobricker's /khide command.
- Changed most /help messages. Thanks to Legobricker for getting
started with those.
- Fixed a bug where /ellipse wasn't being loaded at all.
- Changed the shortcuts of /loginmessage and /logoutmessage so that
they don't conflict.
- If a player is online, /award now accepts the partial name of that
player. Thanks to LegoBricker for implementing this.

r5 (2012-06-03):
- Fixed a rare case of usage of color codes crashing all clients.
- Fixed levels not being saved when being unloaded (regression
introduced in r2).

r4 (2012-05-28):
- Really fixed /portal show and /mb show not working. However, it does
not update until you save or reload the map. In other words, it does not
update instantly. This will be fixed in the future as well as other quirks.

r3 (2012-05-28):

- CTF has been removed for now.
- Minor grammar/spelling/content fixes to various messages.
- Fixed a bug where, under certain circumstances, the first character
of a player's message was being cut off when transmitted to the IRC

issue with Console's chat was also fixed.

as invalid.

preceded with a backslash.
- Changed the output of /devs and /info.
- Data related to portals and message boxes are now backed up with
each backup (except backups of deleted levels).
- Removed some easter egg commands, and removed a usage limit on
some other easter egg commands so that kcapilit can troll more :p
- Other things that I forgot.

r2 (2012-04-25):
- Removed /pcinema, /pcinema2 and /scinema.
- Removed /banlist (it was painfully slow with large banlists).
- Removed /overseer.
- Removed /uban.
- Removed /copyloadnet and /copysavenet.

    - /opchat is now op (was: adv)

- Removed dev and global chat mod immunity from various commands.
- Replaced the incomplete /levels command with a completed one from a
previous version of MCForge.
- Removed /nyan and /pumpkin.
- SQLite3 now reads from MCHmk.db. Rename your database to MCHmk.db
so that MCHmk can read it. There will be an option to specify the file
name in a future update.
- Changed the default server name.
- Added Viewmode.cfg to the .zip file. It defaults to the CLI interface.
- Removed the Updater.
- Removed the ability to use a MCForge forum account.
- Changed something about the admin verification system; new passwords 
need to be generated now! Delete all .xml files in /extra/passwords/ 
and have every admin use /setpass again.
- Plugin support was probably broken.
- Other minor, unimportant changes.
Note: the GUI is not being maintained and may break at any time.

r0 (2012-04-09):
- Exactly the same as the MCForge 5.5.0.2 source code.
